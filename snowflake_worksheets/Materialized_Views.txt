// Create a VIEW that is automatically maintained up to date by Snowflate (cost credits)
// To be used on a specific situation : 
//      - the view query is taking a long time
//      - the table is updated rarely
//      - the tabvle is queried often
// Stream + task is a good alternative, specially on more regularly updated table
// But an alternative to speed up expansive and compex views
